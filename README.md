## Introduction 
Ye Olde Dragon is a statically-typed, object-oriented scripting language whose name was inspired by its parent languages, Python🐉, Javascript 📜, and Swift (like a dragon 🏃‍♂️💨). We intend to bring together the best of all three worlds to create a highly effective and readable language that combines our favorite features and strengths from each. Ye Olde Dragon’s easily understandable syntax makes it an accessible language for beginners and experienced programmers alike, due to its powerful and versatile functionalities.
